ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Samarendra
ðŸŽ¯ I am actively seeking full-time opportunities as a Software Engineer, where I can apply my passion for backend systems, distributed architectures, and cloud-native development.

ðŸ’¡ I specialize in designing scalable, fault-tolerant systems using modern tools like Java (Spring Boot), Python, Kafka, Redis, SQL, NoSQL and AWS. With a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems, I build software thatâ€™s fast, reliable, and production-ready.
